# How Long Since - Technical Specification Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Application Purpose
"How Long Since" is a household task management application that focuses on tracking when tasks were last completed rather than traditional to-do lists. The app helps users identify suitable tasks based on their available time and provides visual indicators for overdue tasks.

### 1.2 Target Audience
Busy individuals managing multiple household responsibilities who want to:
- Track when they last completed recurring tasks
- Identify tasks that fit their available time windows
- Reduce the overwhelming feeling of household maintenance

Our primary personas include:
- **Busy Parents (Alex)**: Healthcare professionals or others with demanding jobs, managing both work and household responsibilities
- **First-time Homeowners (Jordan)**: Learning home maintenance rhythms and requirements, managing pet care alongside home responsibilities
- **Active Retirees (Pat)**: Tracking social connections and enrichment activities, maintaining variety in retirement lifestyle

### 1.3 Core User Story
"As a busy person with lots of household tasks, I want to be able to track how long it's been since I performed certain tasks and identify opportunities to complete tasks within limited available time so that more tasks get done and the list doesn't feel overwhelming."

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js v15 with React v19
- **Styling**: Mantine v3
- **Data Storage**: IndexedDB for client-side storage
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Application Type**: Progressive Web App (PWA)

### 2.2 Development Environment
- Local development on Mac with command-line tools
- Package management via npm or pnpm
