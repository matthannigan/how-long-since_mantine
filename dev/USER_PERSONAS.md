# How Long Since - User Personas Document

## Introduction

This document outlines detailed user personas for the "How Long Since" household task management application. Based on market research and target audience analysis, these personas represent the key user groups who would benefit most from the application's unique approach to task tracking.

"How Long Since" differentiates itself from traditional to-do applications by focusing on tracking when tasks were last completed rather than creating future-oriented to-do lists. This approach helps users identify suitable tasks based on available time and provides visual indicators for overdue tasks.

The following personas illustrate different use cases, pain points, and scenarios that demonstrate how diverse users might interact with and benefit from the application. Each persona includes demographic information, goals, frustrations, motivations, and a representative scenario showing the application in use.
