# How Long Since - Content Strategy Guide

## 1. Introduction

This Content Strategy Guide provides standards for all text within the "How Long Since" application. Our content approach focuses on creating clear, helpful, and efficient communication that aligns with our users' needs and the app's purpose of simplifying household task management.

## 2. Tone and Voice Guidelines

### 2.1 Core Voice Attributes

**Friendly but Efficient**
- Text should be warm but concise
- Avoid unnecessarily long explanations
- Use contractions to create a conversational feel
- Example: "Need to track your last home maintenance tasks? We've got you covered." (not "This application will help you to track when you last performed your household maintenance tasks.")

**Encouraging**
- Use positive reinforcement for task completion
- Celebrate consistency without being overly enthusiastic
- Acknowledge progress without judgment about frequency
- Example: "Nice work! Kitchen deep clean complete." (not "Finally cleaned the kitchen!")

**Helpful**
- Focus on utility and practical guidance
- Anticipate user needs without overexplaining
- Provide clear next steps in workflow situations
- Example: "Add your first task to get started" (not "Please navigate to the task input form to begin creating your task list")

**Direct**
- Use active voice when possible
- Lead with the most important information
- Use action verbs for button text and calls-to-action
- Example: "Mark complete" (not "Click here to mark this task as completed")

### 2.2 Language Standards

**Simplicity**
- Use everyday language, not technical jargon
- Aim for an 8th-grade reading level or lower
- Use short sentences and paragraphs
- Break complex concepts into smaller chunks

**Consistency**
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the app
- Use the same terms for actions (e.g., "complete" not "finish" or "done")
- Ensure category names and time references remain consistent

**Inclusivity**
- Use gender-neutral language
- Avoid culturally specific references that might not translate globally
- Consider users of different abilities and technical comfort levels

### 2.3 Emotion and Personality

"How Long Since" should feel like a helpful household assistant: knowledgeable but not bossy, supportive but not patronizing.

**Do:**
- Use a light touch with humor (sparingly)
- Be conversational but efficient
- Acknowledge the sometimes tedious nature of household tasks

**Don't:**

## 6. Cognitive Load Reduction Through Content

### 6.1 Mental Load Reduction Strategies

**Using Language to Reduce Cognitive Burden:**
- Avoid asking users to remember information the app can track
- Eliminate decision fatigue with clear, actionable suggestions
- Reduce anxiety by using reassuring, non-judgmental language
- Provide just-in-time information rather than requiring advance planning

**Examples:**
- Instead of: "When did you last clean your gutters?"
  Better: "Last gutter cleaning: 6 months ago. Typically needed: Every 6 months."

- Instead of: "Choose a task to complete."
  Better: "You have 20 minutes. Here are tasks that fit:"

- Instead of: "This task is 2 months overdue."
  Better: "Time for air filter change—it's been 3 months."

### 6.2 Quick-Access Content Patterns

- Use color and visual indicators alongside text for faster scanning
- Present the most relevant contextual information first

**Quick Completion:**
- Position "Just Done" text and buttons consistently for muscle memory
- Use short, action-oriented phrases for frequently used functions
- Minimize reading required for routine actions

**Content Shortcuts:**
- For busy parents (Alex): "Quick tasks" category highlighting 5-minute tasks
- For homeowners (Jordan): "Seasonal maintenance" reminders with bundled tasks
- For active retirees (Pat): "Connection reminders" for maintaining relationships

### 6.3 Contextual Awareness in Content

**Time-Based Content:**

**Situation-Based Content:**
- Rainy day: "Perfect time for indoor organizing tasks."
