# How Long Since

A household task management app that tracks when tasks were last completed rather than traditional to-do lists. The app helps users identify suitable tasks based on their available time and provides visual indicators for overdue tasks.

## Overview

"How Long Since" answers the question "How long has it been since...?" for various household responsibilities and activities. Unlike traditional task managers, this app focuses on tracking completion history to help users make informed decisions about what needs attention.

### Core User Story

"As a busy person with various responsibilities, I want to be able to track how long it's been since I performed certain tasks and identify opportunities to complete tasks within limited available time so that more tasks get done and the list doesn't feel overwhelming."

### Target Users

- **Busy Parents**: Managing work and household responsibilities with limited time windows
- **First-time Homeowners**: Learning home maintenance rhythms and building good habits
- **Active Retirees**: Tracking social connections, hobbies, and household tasks

## Key Features

- **Time-based tracking**: Focus on "when last done" rather than due dates
- **Time commitment filtering**: Find tasks that fit your available time (15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hrs, 4hrs, 5hrs+)
- **Visual overdue indicators**: Multiple accessibility-compliant signals for overdue tasks
- **Category organization**: Color-coded categories with icons for easy scanning
- **Offline-first PWA**: Works without internet connection using IndexedDB
- **Accessibility-focused**: WCAG AA compliance with screen reader support
- **Data portability**: Import/export functionality for backup and migration

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Completed
- Project foundation and setup
- Core data layer with IndexedDB schema
- Service layer implementation (TaskService, CategoryService, SettingsService, ExportImportService)
- Task management core features (creation, editing, completion)
- Task display with time formatting and overdue indicators

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Category management system
- Task list views and navigation
- User interface and layout components

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Accessibility implementation (WCAG AA compliance)
- Data persistence and backup features
- User experience enhancements
- Performance optimization
- Progressive Web App features

## Architecture Patterns

- **Offline-first**: IndexedDB for local data persistence
- **Service layer**: Abstracted data services for business logic
- **Component composition**: Reusable UI components with clear props interfaces
- **Hook-based state**: Custom hooks for business logic
- **Type-safe validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation
- **Accessibility-first**: WCAG AA compliance built into components

## Design Principles

- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Optimized for touch interactions
- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG AA standards with screen reader support
- **Offline functionality**: Works without internet connection
- **Encouraging interface**: Non-overwhelming, positive user experience
- **Focus on completion history**: "When last done" rather than "what to do next"

## Data Models

### Task Entity
```typescript
Task {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  categoryId: string
  createdAt: Date
  lastCompletedAt: Date | null
  expectedFrequency: {value: number, unit: string} | null
  timeCommitment: '15min' | '30min' | '1hr' | '2hrs' | '4hrs' | '5hrs+'
  isArchived: boolean
  notes: string
}
```

### Category Entity
```typescript
Category {
  id: string
  name: string
  color: string
  isDefault: boolean
}
```

## Contributing

This project follows test-driven development practices and prioritizes accessibility from the start. All code must pass TypeScript compilation, maintain 80%+ test coverage for business logic, and pass axe-core accessibility tests.
