## Key Reminders for AI Assistant

When writing any UI text, microcopy, or user-facing content:

- Use the voice attributes: Friendly but Efficient, Encouraging, Helpful, Direct
- Follow the microcopy examples for consistency
- Consider the user persona context (Busy Parents, New Homeowners, Active Retirees) as examples of use cases, but remember these are research personas - not the only users of the app
- Write inclusive content that works for diverse users beyond these specific personas
- Apply error message standards for any validation or error scenarios
- Reduce cognitive load through clear, actionable language
- Maintain accessibility standards (8th-grade reading level)

Always reference the full content strategy document for specific examples and detailed guidance.
