# How Long Since App - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "How Long Since" application is a household and personal task management system that focuses on tracking when tasks were last completed rather than creating traditional to-do lists. The app helps users identify suitable tasks based on available time and provides visual indicators for overdue tasks, all while maintaining high accessibility standards.

Unlike traditional task managers, this app answers the question "How long has it been since...?" for various responsibilities and activities, reducing mental load and helping users make better decisions about what to tackle next.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Management System

5. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL allow them to optionally specify a time commitment (15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hrs, 4hrs, 5hrs+)
6. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL allow them to add optional notes (max 512 characters)

6. WHEN a task has an expected frequency and is overdue THEN the system SHALL visually indicate this with multiple accessibility-compliant indicators
7. WHEN calculating overdue status THEN the system SHALL use lastCompletedAt + expectedFrequency compared to current date
8. WHEN a task has no expected frequency THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any overdue status
