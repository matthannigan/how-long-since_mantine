## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) practices
- Implement accessibility features from the start, not as an afterthought
- Use incremental development with working features at each stage
- Prioritize core functionality before advanced features
- Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout development

### Quality Gates
- All code must pass TypeScript compilation without errors
- Unit test coverage must be above 80% for business logic
- All UI components must pass axe-core accessibility tests
- Performance budgets must be maintained (TTI < 3s, FCP < 1.5s)
- Manual accessibility testing required for each major feature

### Dependencies to Add
- `dexie` - IndexedDB wrapper for data persistence
- `zod` - Runtime type validation
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - Enhanced Jest matchers
- `@axe-core/react` - Accessibility testing
- `date-fns` - Date manipulation utilities
- `react-hook-form` - Form management
- `@mantine/form` - Mantine form integration
- `workbox-webpack-plugin` - Service worker generation

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the "How Long Since" application while maintaining high standards for accessibility, performance, and user experience.
